# Smart Factory Energy Consumption Prediction

This notebook contains my solution to the Mechademy DS Intern Assignment.

## Task
Predict the energy consumption of equipment in a smart factory based on sensor and time-series data.

## Approach
- Handled missing values and string labels
- Extracted time features (hour, day, month)
- Performed correlation analysis
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluated model using RMSE and R²

## Results
- RMSE: 11.16
- R² Score: 0.219

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `SmartFactory_EnergyPrediction.ipynb`

## Dependencies
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
